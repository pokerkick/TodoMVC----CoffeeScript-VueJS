#CoffeeScript/Vue.js TodoMVC Example

>CoffeeScript is an abstracted language variation on Javascript, with the goal of simplifying the process coding web scripting by making a more readable code. 
>Whilst being very legible to the layperson not trained in Javascript, CoffeeScript still compiles directly to Javascript before being implemented in the overall application.

>Vue.js is one of many MV* libraries, specifically targeting web interfaces.
Vue focuses on a data-centric approach, with nesting view components.
